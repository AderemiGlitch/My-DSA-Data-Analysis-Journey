# MY-DSA-DATA-ANALYSIS-JOURNEY
I started my portfolio building here during my data analysis training at the Digital SkillUp Africa (DSA).
So far, I have learnt a lot including how to use MS Excel to clean, organize, analyse and visualize data. I also learnt how to use SQL to query structured data.
In addition, I learnt how to create a portfolio from scratch using GitHub. Now, I have a GitHub account.
Currently, I am learning how to use PowerBi to analyze data.
Below is the details of what I learnt using three analytical tools.
Using MS Excel, I learnt:
1.) How to clean data using numbers and text functions like TRIM, PROPER, UPPER, MID, LEFT, RIGHT
2.) How to sort data, create table.
2.) DATE and TIME functions
3.) Conditional functions 'IF', 'AND', 'OR' for analysis
4.) VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP
5.) Pivot table and pivot chart for data summarization
