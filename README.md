# MY-DSA-DATA-ANALYSIS-JOURNEY
I started my portfolio building here during my data analysis training at the Digital SkillUp Africa (DSA).
So far, I have learnt a lot including how to use MS Excel to clean, organize, analyse and visualize data. I also learnt how to use SQL to query structured data.
In addition, I learnt how to create a portfolio from scratch using GitHub. Now, I have a GitHub account.
Currently, I am learning how to use PowerBi to analyze data.
